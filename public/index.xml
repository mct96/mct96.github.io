      <description>Backlog Management Backlog management is a critical aspect of agile project management, particularly in methodologies like Scrum and Kanban. It involves the continuous process of creating, refining, and prioritizing the list of work items, known as the backlog, that need to be completed for a project. Effective backlog management ensures that the team works on the most valuable and relevant tasks, aligns with the project&amp;rsquo;s goals, and adapts to changes efficiently.</description>
